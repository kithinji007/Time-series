# Correlation and Autocorrelation in Time Series - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice your knowledge of correlation, autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation by working on three different datasets. 

## Objectives

In this lab you will: 

- Plot and discuss the autocorrelation function (ACF) for a time series 
- Plot and discuss the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for a time series
